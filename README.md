# Too Many Clocks

For when you want to know the time, but in style!



The name, "Too Many Clocks" is an homage to the classic Adult Swim video from 2014 named [Too Many Cooks](https://youtu.be/QrGrOK8oZG8).\
The term, "Too Many Cooks" comes from the old proverb, "too many cooks spoil the broth," meaning when there are too many people involved in a project, the result may be worse than if there were fewer. However for a plugin like this, I think more options makes for a better experience!
